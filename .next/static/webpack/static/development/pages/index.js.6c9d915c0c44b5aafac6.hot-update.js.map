It\r\n            felt like something which had been missing in my life and my only\r\n            regret was not picking it up sooner. I then decided that this is\r\n            what I wanna do for the rest of my life as it is something that\r\n            always challenges you and picks your brain with all the problem\r\n            solving that it involves. So, my next goal in life was to pursue a\r\n            career in this field. This led me to HyperionDev where I enrolled in\r\n            a Full Stack Web Development course in which I hope to improve upon\r\n            my coding knowledge and hopefully transition into a career in\r\n            Software Development once I'm done.\r\n          </Card.Text>\r\n        </Card.Body>\r\n      </Card>\r\n      <style jsx>{`\r\n        .card {\r\n          backgroundcolor: blue;\r\n          margin: 50px;\r\n        }\r\n        h2 {\r\n          color: red;\r\n        }\r\n      `}</style>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n);\r\nexport default Welcome;\r\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAFA;AACA;AAIA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AANA;AAAA;AAAA;AAFA;AACA;AAkCA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
